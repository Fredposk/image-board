# Image-board Vue.js Project

**Purple** is the name given to my Image-board project. Written with Vue.js and node. First experience with this library and Amazon AWS. 

## Purple

It is an image uploader SPA that is fully responsive made with "mobile-first" approach. Users can upload an image, like and comment. Uploads are saved on the aws-bucket using a node server back-end. Comments are saved with a PostGreSQL database.

## Tech-Stack

Written with the Vue.js CDN it was the transition to begin working with SPA (single-page-applications). Node/Express backend and PostgreSQL database along with amazon aws hosting.
